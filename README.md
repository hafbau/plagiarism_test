## How it works

Editing your git history takes 3 main steps:


### Step 1: Import

In order to import information about past commits in any project, Git History Editor asks you the result of your `git log`.

Because this log is made to be read by a program, it is formatted using the `--pretty=format` option of `git log`, then encoded
to `base64` to avoid problems with carriage returns or spaces. 

Only the last 1000 commits are imported, because a really huge commit history could drastically slow down your browser, or even make it crash.

The import command to run is the following:

```bash
git log -1000 --pretty=format:"%H*#%an*#%ae*#%at*#%s" | base64
```


### Step 2: Edit

Git History Editor has a nice UI designed to let you edit what you want in each one of your past commits, or create a rule that will apply to multiple commits. [Just try it](https://git.io/editor).


### Step 3: Export

When the `edit` step is finished, Git History Editor provides a script that you can run in order to apply the changes immediatly.

This script uses the `git filter-branch` command, which is the less painful way to rewrite a git branch history with precision.
